## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.

# Configuration

Start by cloning the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git <your-frontend-project-name>
```

The project uses [Atom](https://atom.io/) in development. In your local environment, please [download](https://atom.io/) Atom and install it. Hit ```CMD+SHFT+P``` if you're on a Mac or ```CTRL+SHFT+P``` if you're using a Windows machine. Start typing "Install Package", select "Setting View: Install Packages and Themes" and hit enter. This opens the "Install" section of "Setting". In the search box, enter "atom-live-server", click enter and scroll down to the "atom-live-server" package and install it. ```atom-live-server``` launch a simple development HTTP server with live reload capability.

## Run the Application

Run the application using the rails server task:

```
$ rails s
```

Atom runs a simple server on port 3000. To view it in a any browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
